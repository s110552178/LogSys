# LogSys

Just download and new the class. Enjoy!!!

Recommand: Give a specific directory and file name to put your log when you new the class "Log". 
If not, it will automatically create the directory in your driver's root which you run the program. And the file name will be named by date.


e.g. Log _log = new Log("Your_Log_File_Where_You_Want_To_Put");
